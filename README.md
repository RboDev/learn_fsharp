# (re) Learn FSharp

After programming with C# for a some years, learning F# has been a lot of fun.
It was harder to code with F# but very exciting to see how number of lines shrinks.

I completed those trainings

* [Programming in F#](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV207.1x+1T2016/home)

And even had a go with Haskell to better understand pure functional programming
 * [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:DelftX+FP101x+3T2015/home)
 [Certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/cd53933688eb4662a5db11b05bceb5f3)

 I only had the opportunity to develop a fez scripts with FSharp.
 Then had to use C# then Python.

 Maybe it's time to revisit F# 5.0 now... and have fun again with that beautiful language.
